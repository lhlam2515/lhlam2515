# 👋 Hi, I'm Hoang-Lam (SoJDev)

I chose the name SoJDev, derived from SoJ _/sɔːdʒ/_, as a daily reminder to myself. I want to be a “Sage” – someone who persistently learns and explores technology – and I also want to “Soar” – to rise higher by turning knowledge into meaningful software that touches people’s lives. For me, development is not just a job, but a journey of growing alongside knowledge and passion.


## 🚀 About Me

* 💻 Skilled in **full-stack development** (React, Next.js, MongoDB, and more).
* 🤖 Passionate about building **AI-powered and intelligent applications**.
* 🤝 Open to **collaborating on impactful projects** and contributing to innovative teams.
* 🌱 **Working towards becoming a versatile full-stack developer and future tech leader.**


## 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning/Working On

* Actively studying **Generative AI and LLMs**, with a research-driven interest in **intelligent multi-agent architectures**.
* Developing knowledge progressively to contribute to **future academic and applied research in multi-agent systems**.
