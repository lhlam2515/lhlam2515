# 👋 Hi, I'm Hoang-Lam (SoJDev)

The name **SoJDev** isn't just a handle; it's my personal philosophy for growth. It combines the idea of being a **'Sage'** – someone dedicated to mastering intricate technical landscapes – with the drive to **'Soar'** – leveraging that profound knowledge to build high-impact, pioneering software. For me, development is a journey of relentless learning and transformative creation.
